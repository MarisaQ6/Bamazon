# Bamazon

A mock website inpired by something I use almost monthly, ~~Amazon~~ **BAMAZON** creates a list of items for sale, a table of the items and lists the items availalbe in a search and bid mode. The items are pulled from the original inspo website, but prices have been changed. 


## How I Started:

1. The first step was to set up all the necessary files, packages and folders. 
2. Creating a table in MySql
3. Pulling the information into Node and running the program.

## Applications Used:

* Javascript
* MySql
* Node

### The Results:
